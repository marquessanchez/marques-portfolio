                At this moment I can a sales professional at Malouf Cadillac. My experiences with sales has been very exciting as I am faced with different people and their needs. As you see above, I closed a deal with the hip-hop artist Joey Bada$$. I find myself always being curious to figure things out and how things operate. I have developed that trait by playing sports and working on fundamentals to ensure I am a master at the basics before moving onto more difficult practices. From growing up being an athlete, I am able to utilize my skills to collaborate with a team to accomplish a goal. These attributes all molded me to become someone who is willing to work independently as well as collectively with a group made me want to find a career where I can use these stregnths and have fun while doing it. That's when I came to a decision I will lvoe to continue practcing coding. Now, as a future junior developer, I am commtted to learning a good foundation to front end and back end development and ultimately be apart of a successful company.

                I am proud to have my first group project completed. This project is named "Dinner-Time". It was inspired by a collaborated idea that most poeple live a busy lifestyle and to find time to eat a delicious dinner can get very difficult. Our group was able to put together an app to allow users to find a dinner which includes a meal and a drink to go with it. We took it a step farther to allow a user to save a meal or drink. This can make a quick access to favorite meals and drinks. Eye-popping CSS work was implemented for fun.

                I am proud to have my second group project completed. This project is named "FUGG LOVE". It was inspired by one member of the group being a photographer who had an idea for people to be able to have a login to view his content. He wants to allow future clients to view his content. His content is broken down to different galleries or models and inside the gallery you can find photos that clints can download. Our future development is to add more galleries to current galleries. Also this project can be used to link clients social media platforms like Instagram to view more photos.
